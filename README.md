**Title:** Facebook 2.0 Clone (Frontend) with Tailwind CSS, Clerk Authentication, React, Next.js 14, and TypeScript

This project is a work in progress, currently focusing on the frontend development of a Facebook 2.0 clone. It leverages the following powerful technologies:

- **Clerk Authentication:** A seamless user authentication solution.
- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Next.js 14:** A full-stack React framework for server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing.
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript for type safety and improved code maintainability.
